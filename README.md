# weather-app

In 2016 I knuckled down with programming and started on some courses to get myself employable. A project for one of those courses was a weather app -- the project was pretty ugly, and written badly (I committed my API keys directly to github!).

My aim this year is to get more practice in my own time, so over the course of a few hours I recreated that weather app (and I think it's much better!)

### Run it

It's written in Vue3, uses vite. Can run locally with `npm run serve`. It expects an API key as an environment variable: `VUE_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY`.
